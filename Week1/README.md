Week1 : In this week, we had an introduction to both the quantum computing and information part, as well as the required Mathematics for the topic. 

We first learnt about Quantum bits, or Qubits, where we learnt about how they are in a superposition of two basis states. We extended the concept to multiple qubits.

We then looked at basic Quantum Computation, representing gates as unitary matrices and developing single qubit gates and multi qubit gates. We then went to measurements in different bases, such as the computational basis and the Hadamard Basis. We then talked about entanglement and Bell states, and used that to learn about a very interesting concept of Quantum Teleportation.

We then moved to different algorithms, by first introducing Toffoli Gates, which allows us to perform classical operations reversibly on a Quantum circuit. We then went to Quantum parallelism, followed by Deutsch's and Deutsch Josza's Algorithm.

Onto the Math part, we covered the basics of Linear Algebra, and looked at Pauli's operators (matrices I,X,Y and Z). We looked at inner products, eigen values and eigen vectors, while introducing cool notation, called the outer product of two vectors. We then went into Hermitian operators and looked at their properties. Tensor products were also introduced, after which we moved on to the commutator and the anti-commutator.

We then had a brief overview through the postulates of Quantum Mechanics.
